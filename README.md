This repository demonstrates a potential bug in Rust related to modifying vectors using raw pointers. The bug occurs when the vector is reallocated during runtime. Modifying the memory location pointed to by the raw pointer after reallocation can lead to undefined behavior, potentially causing unexpected program crashes or data corruption. The solution provides a safe alternative using standard vector methods.
